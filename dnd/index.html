    You can use the combination of Terraform and Yeoman. Terraform is a tool for creating
                        infrastructure on Azure. Yeoman makes it easy to create Terraform modules.
    <br/>
    Terratest provides a collection of helper functions and patterns for common infrastructure
                        testing tasks, like making HTTP requests and using SSH to access a specific virtual machine. The
                        following list describes some of the major advantages of using Terratest:
    <br/>
    ✑ Convenient helpers to check infrastructure - This feature is useful when you want to verify
                        your real infrastructure in the real environment.
    <br/>
    ✑ Organized folder structure - Your test cases are organized clearly and follow the standard
                        Terraform module folder structure.
    <br/>
    Test cases are written in Go - Many developers who use Terraform are Go developers. If you're a
                        Go developer, you don't have to learn another programming
    <br/>
    <img class="in-exam-image" src="https://examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04156/0002300004.png"/>
    language to use Terratest.
    <br/>
    ✑ Extensible infrastructure - You can extend additional functions on top of Terratest, including
                        Azure-specific features.

    Exceptions in your live web app are reported by Application Insights.
    <br/>
    Note: Periodical reports help keep a team informed on how their business critical services are
                        doing. Developers, DevOps/SRE teams, and their managers can be productive with automated reports
                        reliably delivering insights without requiring everyone to sign in the portal. Such reports can
                        also help identify gradual increases in latencies, load or failure rates that may not trigger
                        any alert rules.
    <br/>
    You can programmatically query Application Insights data to generate custom reports on a
                        schedule. The following options can help you get started quickly:

                        tasks on the taskboard.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Box 2: Agile -
    <br/>
    Choose Agile when your team uses Agile planning methods, including Scrum, and tracks development
                        and test activities separately. This process works great if you want to track user stories and
                        (optionally) bugs on the Kanban board, or track bugs and tasks on the taskboard.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Box 3: CMMI -
    <br/>
    Choose CMMI when your team follows more formal project methods that require a framework for
                        process improvement and an auditable record of decisions. With this process, you can track
                        requirements, change requests, risks, and reviews.

                        they can be used together, but they have different base concepts inside them.

   Your company has a project in Azure DevOps.
   <br/>
   You plan to create a release pipeline that will deploy resources by using Azure Resource Manager
                    templates. The templates will reference secrets stored in Azure
   <br/>
   Key Vault.
   <br/>
   You need to recommend a solution for accessing the secrets stored in the key vault during
                    deployments. The solution must use the principle of least privilege.
   <br/>
   What should you include in the recommendation? To answer, drag the appropriate configurations to the
                    correct targets. Each configuration may be used once, more than once, or not at all. You may need to

    In addition to all the permissions given the Reader and the Service Account role, members of the

                        Finally, they can also manage membership for all roles of the organization agent pool. The user
                        that created the organization agent pool is automatically added to the Administrator role for

    Step 1: Create a YAML file.
    <br/>
    If your AKS cluster is RBAC-enabled, you must create a service account and role binding for use
                        with Tiller. To create a service account and role binding, create a file named
                        rbac-virtual-kubelet.yaml
    <br/>
    Step 2: Run kubectl apply.
    <br/>
    Apply the service account and binding with kubectl apply and specify your
                        rbac-virtual-kubelet.yaml file.
    <br/>
    Step 3: Run helm init.
    <br/>
    Configure Helm to use the tiller service account:
    <br/>
    helm init --service-account tiller
    <br/>
    You can now continue to installing the Virtual Kubelet into your AKS cluster.

    All Azure Artifacts feeds require authentication, so you'll need to store credentials for the
                        feed before you can install or publish packages. npm uses .npmrc configuration files to store
                        feed URLs and credentials. Azure DevOps Services recommends using two .npmrc files.
    <br/>
    Feed registry information: The .npmrc file in the project
    <br/>
    One .npmrc should live at the root of your git repo adjacent to your project's package.json. It
                        should contain a "registry" line for your feed and it should not contain credentials since it
                        will be checked into git.
    <br/>
    Credentials: The .npmrc file in the user's home folder
    <br/>
    On your development machine, you will also have a .npmrc in $home for Linux or Mac systems or
                        $env.HOME for win systems. This .npmrc should contain credentials for all of the registries that
                        you need to connect to. The NPM client will look at your project's .npmrc, discover the
                        registry, and fetch matching credentials from $home/.npmrc or $env.HOME/.npmrc.

    <br/>
    Once your code quality is verified, and the application is deployed to a lower environment like
                        development or QA, the process should verify that there are not any security vulnerabilities in
                        the running application. This can be accomplished by executing automated penetration test
                        against the running application to scan it for vulnerabilities.

    Step 1: Create a dependency graph for the application
    <br/>
    By linking work items and other objects, you can track related work, dependencies, and changes
                        made over time. All links are defined with a specific link type. For example, you can use
                        Parent/Child links to link work items to support a hierarchical tree structure. Whereas, the
                        Commit and Branch link types support links between work items and commits and branches,
                        respectively.
    <br/>
    Step 2: Group the related components.
    <br/>
    Packages enable you to share code across your organization: you can compose a large product,
                        develop multiple products based on a common shared framework, or create and share reusable
                        components and libraries.
    <br/>
    Step 3: Assign ownership to each component graph

    One downside, however, is that Bitubucket does not include support for SVN but this can be

    Bitbucket:
    <br/>
    Bitbucket comes as a distributed version control system based on Git.
    <br/>
    Note: A source control system, also called a version control system, allows developers to
                        collaborate on code and track changes. Source control is an essential tool for multi-developer
                        projects.
    <br/>
    Our systems support two types of source control: Git (distributed) and Team Foundation Version
                        Control (TFVC). TFVC is a centralized, client-server system. In both Git and TFVC, you can check
                        in files and organize files in folders, branches, and repositories.

    Box 1: mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:5.0
    <br/>
    The first group of lines declares from which base image we will use to build our container on
                        top of. If the local system does not have this image already, then docker will automatically try
                        and fetch it. The mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk:5.0 comes packaged with the .NET core 5.0
                        SDK installed, so it's up to the task of building ASP .NET core projects targeting version 5.0
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Box 2: dotnet restore -
    <br/>
    The next instruction changes the working directory in our container to be /app, so all commands
                        following this one execute under this context.
    <br/>
    COPY *.csproj ./
    <br/>
    <br/>
    RUN dotnet restore -
    <br/>
    Box 3: mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:5.0
    <br/>
    When building container images, it's good practice to include only the production payload and
                        its dependencies in the container image. We don't want the .NET core SDK included in our final
                        image because we only need the .NET core runtime, so the dockerfile is written to use a
                        temporary container that is packaged with the SDK called build-env to build the app.

    <br/>
    Step 2: Create a deployment group

    Step 1: Assign the node configuration.
    <br/>
    You create a simple DSC configuration that ensures either the presence or absence of the
                        Web-Server Windows Feature (IIS), depending on how you assign nodes.
    <br/>
    Step 2: Upload a configuration to Azure Automation State Configuration.
    <br/>
    You import the configuration into the Automation account.
    <br/>
    Step 3: Compiling a configuration into a node configuration
    <br/>
    Compiling a configuration in Azure Automation
    <br/>
    Before you can apply a desired state to a node, a DSC configuration defining that state must be
                        compiled into one or more node configurations (MOF document), and placed on the Automation DSC
                        Pull Server.
    <br/>
    Step 4: Onboard the virtual machines to Azure State Configuration
    <br/>
    Onboarding an Azure VM for management with Azure Automation State Configuration
    <br/>
    Step 5: Check the compliance status of the node.
    <br/>
    Viewing reports for managed nodes. Each time Azure Automation State Configuration performs a
                        consistency check on a managed node, the node sends a status report back to the pull server. You
                        can view these reports on the page for that node.
    <br/>
    On the blade for an individual report, you can see the following status information for the
                        corresponding consistency check:
    <br/>

    Step 1: Kubectl create -
    <br/>
    You can add a service account to Tiller using the --service-account &lt;NAME&gt; flag while
                        you're configuring Helm (step 2 below). As a prerequisite, you'll have to create a role binding
                        which specifies a role and a service account name that have been set up in advance.
    <br/>
    Example: Service account with cluster-admin role
    <br/>
    $ kubectl create -f rbac-config.yaml
    <br/>
    serviceaccount "tiller" created
    <br/>
    clusterrolebinding "tiller" created
    <br/>
    $ helm init --service-account tiller
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Step 2: helm init -
    <br/>
    To deploy a basic Tiller into an AKS cluster, use the helm init command.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Step 3: helm install -
    <br/>
    To install charts with Helm, use the helm install command and specify the name of the chart to
                        install.

    The process to associate an automated test with a test case is:
    <br/>
    1. Create a test project containing your automated test. What types of tests are supported?
    <br/>
    2. Check your test project into an Azure DevOps or Team Foundation Server (TFS) repository.
    <br/>
    3. Create a build pipeline for your project, ensuring that it contains the automated test. What
                        are the differences if I am still using a XAML build?
    <br/>
    4. Use Visual Studio Enterprise or Professional 2017 or a later version to associate the
                        automated test with a test case as shown below. The test case must have been added to a test
                        plan that uses the build you just defined.

    You can set up a CI/CD pipeline to deploy your apps on a Kubernetes cluster with Azure DevOps by
                        leveraging a Linux agent, Docker, and Helm.
    <br/>
    Step 1: Create a service principle in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)
    <br/>
    We need to assign 3 specific service principals with specific Azure Roles that need to interact
                        with our ACR and our AKS.
    <br/>
    Create a specific Service Principal for our Azure DevOps pipelines to be able to push and pull
                        images and charts of our ACR.

    Create a specific Service Principal for our Azure DevOps pipelines to be able to deploy our
                        application in our AKS.
    <br/>
    Step 2: Add a Helm package and deploy a task to the deployment pipeline
    <br/>
    This is the DevOps workflow with containers:

    <img class="in-exam-image" src="https://examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04156/0042400001.png"/>
    <br/>
    Step 3: Add a Docker Compose task to the deployment pipeline.
    <br/>
    Dockerfile file is a script leveraged by Docker, composed of various commands (instructions) and
                        arguments listed successively to automatically perform actions on a base image in order to
                        create a new Docker image by packaging the app.

    App1: Canary deployment -
    <br/>
    With canary deployment, you deploy a new application code in a small part of the production
                        infrastructure. Once the application is signed off for release, only a few users are routed to
                        it. This minimizes any impact.
    <br/>
    With no errors reported, the new version can gradually roll out to the rest of the
                        infrastructure.
    <br/>
    App2: Rolling deployment:
    <br/>
    In a rolling deployment, an application's new version gradually replaces the old one. The actual
                        deployment happens over a period of time. During that time, new and old versions will coexist
                        without affecting functionality or user experience. This process makes it easier to roll back
                        any new component incompatible with the old components.

    Blue/Green deployment -
    <br/>
    A blue/green deployment is a change management strategy for releasing software code. Blue/green
                        deployments, which may also be referred to as A/B deployments require two identical hardware
                        environments that are configured exactly the same way. While one environment is active and
                        serving end users, the other environment remains idle.
    <br/>
    Blue/green deployments are often used for consumer-facing applications and applications with
                        critical uptime requirements. New code is released to the inactive environment, where it is
                        thoroughly tested. Once the code has been vetted, the team makes the idle environment active,
                        typically by adjusting a router configuration to redirect application program traffic. The
                        process reverses when the next software iteration is ready for release.

    Step 1: Create a repository -
    <br/>
    A Git repository, or repo, is a folder that you've told Git to help you track file changes in.
                        You can have any number of repos on your computer, each stored in their own folder.

    Step 1: Create a Desired State Configuration (DSC) configuration file that has an extension of
                        .ps1.
    <br/>
    Step 2: Run the Import-AzureRmAutomationDscConfiguration Azure Powershell cmdlet
    <br/>
    The Import-AzureRmAutomationDscConfiguration cmdlet imports an APS Desired State Configuration
                        (DSC) configuration into Azure Automation. Specify the path of an APS script that contains a
                        single DSC configuration.
    <br/>
    Example:
    <br/>
    PS C:\&gt;Import-AzureRmAutomationDscConfiguration -AutomationAccountName
                        "Contoso17"-ResourceGroupName "ResourceGroup01" -SourcePath "C:\DSC
    <br/>
    \client.ps1" -Force
    <br/>
    This command imports the DSC configuration in the file named client.ps1 into the Automation
                        account named Contoso17. The command specifies the Force parameter. If there is an existing DSC
                        configuration, this command replaces it.
    <br/>
    Step 3: Run the Start-AzureRmAutomationDscCompilationJob Azure Powershell cmdlet

   Overview -
   <br/>
   Litware, Inc. is an independent software vendor (ISV). Litware has a main office and five branch
                    offices.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Existing Environment -
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Application Architecture -
   <br/>
   The company's primary application is a single monolithic retirement fund management system based on
                    ASP.NET web forms that use logic written in VB.NET.
   <br/>
   Some new sections of the application are written in C#.
   <br/>
   Variations of the application are created for individual customers. Currently, there are more than
                    80 live code branches in the application's code base.
   <br/>
   The application was developed by using Microsoft Visual Studio. Source code is stored in Team
                    Foundation Server (TFS) in the main office. The branch offices access the source code by using TFS
                    proxy servers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Architectural Issues -
   <br/>
   Litware focuses on writing new code for customers. No resources are provided to refactor or remove
                    existing code. Changes to the code base take a long time, as dependencies are not obvious to
                    individual developers.
   <br/>
   Merge operations of the code often take months and involve many developers. Code merging frequently
                    introduces bugs that are difficult to locate and resolve.
   <br/>
   Customers report that ownership costs of the retirement fund management system increase continually.
                    The need to merge unrelated code makes even minor code changes expensive.
   <br/>
   Customers report that bug reporting is overly complex.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Requirements -
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Planned Changes -
   <br/>
   Litware plans to develop a new suite of applications for investment planning. The investment
                    planning applications will require only minor integration with the existing retirement fund
                    management system.
   <br/>
   The investment planning applications suite will include one multi-tier web application and two iOS
                    mobile applications. One mobile application will be used by employees; the other will be used by
                    customers.
   <br/>
   Litware plans to move to a more agile development methodology. Shared code will be extracted into a
                    series of packages.
   <br/>
   Litware has started an internal cloud transformation process and plans to use cloud-based services
                    whenever suitable.
   <br/>
   Litware wants to become proactive in detecting failures, rather than always waiting for customer bug
                    reports.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Technical Requirements -
   <br/>
   The company's investment planning applications suite must meet the following technical requirements:
   <br/>
   New incoming connections through the firewall must be minimized.
   <br/>
   Members of a group named Developers must be able to install packages.
   <br/>
   The principle of least privilege must be used for all permission assignments.
   <br/>
   A branching strategy that supports developing new functionality in isolation must be used.
   <br/>
   Members of a group named Team Leaders must be able to create new packages and edit the permissions
                    of package feeds.
   <br/>
   Visual Studio App Center must be used to centralize the reporting of mobile application crashes and
                    device types in use.
   <br/>
   By default, all releases must remain available for 30 days, except for production releases, which
                    must be kept for 60 days.
   <br/>
   Code quality and release quality are critical. During release, deployments must not proceed between
                    stages if any active bugs are logged against the release.
   <br/>
   The mobile applications must be able to call the share pricing service of the existing retirement
                    fund management system. Until the system is upgraded, the service will only support basic
                    authentication over HTTPS.
   <br/>
   The required operating system configuration for the test servers changes weekly. Azure Automation
                    State Configuration must be used to ensure that the operating system on each test server is
                    configured the same way when the servers are created and checked periodically.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Current Technical Issue -
   <br/>
   The test servers are configured correctly when first deployed, but they experience configuration
                    drift over time. Azure Automation State Configuration fails to correct the configurations.
   <br/>
   Azure Automation State Configuration nodes are registered by using the following command.

    Box 1: Azure Boards -
    <br/>
    Azure Boards can be used to track work with Kanban boards, backlogs, team dashboards, and custom
                        reporting
    <br/>
    You can create multiple Trello boards, which are spaces to store tasks (for different work
                        contexts, or even private boards)
    <br/>
    You can easily share Trello boards with another person.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Box 2: Azure Pipelines -
    <br/>
    You can use Bamboo to implement CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery) for a
                        simple Azure function app using Atlassian Bamboo. Bamboo does continuous delivery of the project
                        from source code to deployment. It has stages including Build, Test and Deploy.
    <br/>
    Software teams in every industry are upgrading their continuous delivery pipeline with Bamboo.
                        Easy build import from popular open source tools, user and group import from JIRA, seamless
                        integration with Bitbucket, and native support for Git, Hg, and SVN means you'll be building and
                        deploying like a champ.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Box 3: GitHub repositories -
    <br/>
    Bitbucket can be used as the Git repository, but you can use any other Git repository (Like TFS
                        Git) for source control of the code.

    <br/>
    Step 1: Sign in to Azure Devops by using an account that is assigned the Administrator service
                        connection security role.
    <br/>
    Note: Under Agent Phase, click Deploy Service Fabric Application. Click Docker Settings and then
                        click Configure Docker settings. In Registry Credentials Source, select Azure Resource Manager
                        Service Connection. Then select your Azure subscription.
    <br/>
    Step 2: Create a personal access token..
    <br/>
    A personal access token or PAT is required so that a machine can join the pool created with the
                        Agent Pools (read, manage) scope.
    <br/>
    Step 3: Install and register the Azure Pipelines agent on an Azure virtual machine.
    <br/>
    By running a Azure Pipeline agent in the cluster, we make it possible to test any service,
                        regardless of type.

    Scenario: Implement Project3, Project5, Project6, and Project7 based on the planned changes
    <br/>
    <img class="in-exam-image" src="https://examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04156/0037100002.png"/>
    <br/>
    Step 1: Open the release pipeline editor.
    <br/>
    In the Releases tab of Azure Pipelines, select your release pipeline and choose Edit to open the
                        pipeline editor.
    <br/>
    Step 2: Enable Gates.
    <br/>
    Choose the pre-deployment conditions icon for the Production stage to open the conditions panel.
                        Enable gates by using the switch control in the Gates section.
    <br/>
    Step 3: Add Query Work items.
    <br/>
    Choose + Add and select the Query Work Items gate.
    <br/>
    Configure the gate by selecting an existing work item query.
    <br/>
    <img class="in-exam-image" src="https://examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04156/0037300001.png"/>
    <br/>
    Note: A case for release gate is:
    <br/>
    Incident and issues management. Ensure the required status for work items, incidents, and
                        issues. For example, ensure deployment occurs only if no priority zero bugs exist, and
                        validation that there are no active incidents takes place after deployment.
