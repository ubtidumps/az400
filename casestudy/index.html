   <br/>
   Overview -
   <br/>
   Litware, Inc. is an independent software vendor (ISV). Litware has a main office and five branch
                    offices.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Existing Environment -
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Application Architecture -
   <br/>
   The company's primary application is a single monolithic retirement fund management system based on
                    ASP.NET web forms that use logic written in VB.NET.
   <br/>
   Some new sections of the application are written in C#.
   <br/>
   Variations of the application are created for individual customers. Currently, there are more than
                    80 live code branches in the application's code base.
   <br/>
   The application was developed by using Microsoft Visual Studio. Source code is stored in Team
                    Foundation Server (TFS) in the main office. The branch offices access the source code by using TFS
                    proxy servers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Architectural Issues -
   <br/>
   Litware focuses on writing new code for customers. No resources are provided to refactor or remove
                    existing code. Changes to the code base take a long time, as dependencies are not obvious to
                    individual developers.
   <br/>
   Merge operations of the code often take months and involve many developers. Code merging frequently
                    introduces bugs that are difficult to locate and resolve.
   <br/>
   Customers report that ownership costs of the retirement fund management system increase continually.
                    The need to merge unrelated code makes even minor code changes expensive.
   <br/>
   Customers report that bug reporting is overly complex.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Requirements -
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Planned Changes -
   <br/>
   Litware plans to develop a new suite of applications for investment planning. The investment
                    planning applications will require only minor integration with the existing retirement fund
                    management system.
   <br/>
   The investment planning applications suite will include one multi-tier web application and two iOS
                    mobile applications. One mobile application will be used by employees; the other will be used by
                    customers.
   <br/>
   Litware plans to move to a more agile development methodology. Shared code will be extracted into a
                    series of packages.
   <br/>
   Litware has started an internal cloud transformation process and plans to use cloud-based services
                    whenever suitable.
   <br/>
   Litware wants to become proactive in detecting failures, rather than always waiting for customer bug
                    reports.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Technical Requirements -
   <br/>
   The company's investment planning applications suite must meet the following technical requirements:
   <br/>
   New incoming connections through the firewall must be minimized.
   <br/>
   Members of a group named Developers must be able to install packages.
   <br/>
   The principle of least privilege must be used for all permission assignments.
   <br/>
   A branching strategy that supports developing new functionality in isolation must be used.
   <br/>
   Members of a group named Team Leaders must be able to create new packages and edit the permissions
                    of package feeds.
   <br/>
   Visual Studio App Center must be used to centralize the reporting of mobile application crashes and
                    device types in use.
   <br/>
   By default, all releases must remain available for 30 days, except for production releases, which
                    must be kept for 60 days.
   <br/>
   Code quality and release quality are critical. During release, deployments must not proceed between
                    stages if any active bugs are logged against the release.
   <br/>
   The mobile applications must be able to call the share pricing service of the existing retirement
                    fund management system. Until the system is upgraded, the service will only support basic
                    authentication over HTTPS.
   <br/>
   The required operating system configuration for the test servers changes weekly. Azure Automation
                    State Configuration must be used to ensure that the operating system on each test server is
                    configured the same way when the servers are created and checked periodically.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Current Technical Issue -
   <br/>
   The test servers are configured correctly when first deployed, but they experience configuration
                    drift over time. Azure Automation State Configuration fails to correct the configurations.
   <br/>
   Azure Automation State Configuration nodes are registered by using the following command.

   Case Study -
   <br/>
   This is a case study. Case studies are not timed separately. You can use as much exam time as you
                    would like to complete each case. However, there may be additional case studies and sections on this
                    exam. You must manage your time to ensure that you are able to complete all questions included on
                    this exam in the time provided.
   <br/>
   To answer the questions included in a case study, you will need to reference information that is
                    provided in the case study. Case studies might contain exhibits and other resources that provide
                    more information about the scenario that is described in the case study. Each question is
                    independent of the other questions in this case study.
   <br/>
   At the end of this case study, a review screen will appear. This screen allows you to review your
                    answers and to make changes before you move to the next section of the exam. After you begin a new
                    section, you cannot return to this section.

    Step 1: Create a Desired State Configuration (DSC) configuration file that has an extension of
                        .ps1.
    <br/>
    Step 2: Run the Import-AzureRmAutomationDscConfiguration Azure Powershell cmdlet
    <br/>
    The Import-AzureRmAutomationDscConfiguration cmdlet imports an APS Desired State Configuration
                        (DSC) configuration into Azure Automation. Specify the path of an APS script that contains a
                        single DSC configuration.
    <br/>
    Example:
    <br/>
    PS C:\&gt;Import-AzureRmAutomationDscConfiguration -AutomationAccountName
                        "Contoso17"-ResourceGroupName "ResourceGroup01" -SourcePath "C:\DSC
    <br/>
    \client.ps1" -Force
    <br/>
    This command imports the DSC configuration in the file named client.ps1 into the Automation
                        account named Contoso17. The command specifies the Force parameter. If there is an existing DSC
                        configuration, this command replaces it.
    <br/>
    Step 3: Run the Start-AzureRmAutomationDscCompilationJob Azure Powershell cmdlet
    <br/>
    The Start-AzureRmAutomationDscCompilationJob cmdlet compiles an APS Desired State Configuration
                        (DSC) configuration in Azure Automation.

   <br/>
   Overview -
   <br/>
   Litware, Inc. is an independent software vendor (ISV). Litware has a main office and five branch
                    offices.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Existing Environment -
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Application Architecture -
   <br/>
   The company's primary application is a single monolithic retirement fund management system based on
                    ASP.NET web forms that use logic written in VB.NET.
   <br/>
   Some new sections of the application are written in C#.
   <br/>
   Variations of the application are created for individual customers. Currently, there are more than
                    80 live code branches in the application's code base.
   <br/>
   The application was developed by using Microsoft Visual Studio. Source code is stored in Team
                    Foundation Server (TFS) in the main office. The branch offices access the source code by using TFS
                    proxy servers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Architectural Issues -
   <br/>
   Litware focuses on writing new code for customers. No resources are provided to refactor or remove
                    existing code. Changes to the code base take a long time, as dependencies are not obvious to
                    individual developers.
   <br/>
   Merge operations of the code often take months and involve many developers. Code merging frequently
                    introduces bugs that are difficult to locate and resolve.
   <br/>
   Customers report that ownership costs of the retirement fund management system increase continually.
                    The need to merge unrelated code makes even minor code changes expensive.
   <br/>
   Customers report that bug reporting is overly complex.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Requirements -
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Planned Changes -
   <br/>
   Litware plans to develop a new suite of applications for investment planning. The investment
                    planning applications will require only minor integration with the existing retirement fund
                    management system.
   <br/>
   The investment planning applications suite will include one multi-tier web application and two iOS
                    mobile applications. One mobile application will be used by employees; the other will be used by
                    customers.
   <br/>
   Litware plans to move to a more agile development methodology. Shared code will be extracted into a
                    series of packages.
   <br/>
   Litware has started an internal cloud transformation process and plans to use cloud-based services
                    whenever suitable.
   <br/>
   Litware wants to become proactive in detecting failures, rather than always waiting for customer bug
                    reports.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Technical Requirements -
   <br/>
   The company's investment planning applications suite must meet the following technical requirements:
   <br/>
   New incoming connections through the firewall must be minimized.
   <br/>
   Members of a group named Developers must be able to install packages.
   <br/>
   The principle of least privilege must be used for all permission assignments.
   <br/>
   A branching strategy that supports developing new functionality in isolation must be used.
   <br/>
   Members of a group named Team Leaders must be able to create new packages and edit the permissions
                    of package feeds.
   <br/>
   Visual Studio App Center must be used to centralize the reporting of mobile application crashes and
                    device types in use.
   <br/>
   By default, all releases must remain available for 30 days, except for production releases, which
                    must be kept for 60 days.
   <br/>
   Code quality and release quality are critical. During release, deployments must not proceed between
                    stages if any active bugs are logged against the release.
   <br/>
   The mobile applications must be able to call the share pricing service of the existing retirement
                    fund management system. Until the system is upgraded, the service will only support basic
                    authentication over HTTPS.
   <br/>
   The required operating system configuration for the test servers changes weekly. Azure Automation
                    State Configuration must be used to ensure that the operating system on each test server is
                    configured the same way when the servers are created and checked periodically.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Current Technical Issue -
   <br/>
   The test servers are configured correctly when first deployed, but they experience configuration
                    drift over time. Azure Automation State Configuration fails to correct the configurations.
   <br/>
   Azure Automation State Configuration nodes are registered by using the following command.

   <br/>
   Overview -
   <br/>
   Litware, Inc. is an independent software vendor (ISV). Litware has a main office and five branch
                    offices.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Existing Environment -
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Application Architecture -
   <br/>
   The company's primary application is a single monolithic retirement fund management system based on
                    ASP.NET web forms that use logic written in VB.NET.
   <br/>
   Some new sections of the application are written in C#.
   <br/>
   Variations of the application are created for individual customers. Currently, there are more than
                    80 live code branches in the application's code base.
   <br/>
   The application was developed by using Microsoft Visual Studio. Source code is stored in Team
                    Foundation Server (TFS) in the main office. The branch offices access the source code by using TFS
                    proxy servers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Architectural Issues -
   <br/>
   Litware focuses on writing new code for customers. No resources are provided to refactor or remove
                    existing code. Changes to the code base take a long time, as dependencies are not obvious to
                    individual developers.
   <br/>
   Merge operations of the code often take months and involve many developers. Code merging frequently
                    introduces bugs that are difficult to locate and resolve.
   <br/>
   Customers report that ownership costs of the retirement fund management system increase continually.
                    The need to merge unrelated code makes even minor code changes expensive.
   <br/>
   Customers report that bug reporting is overly complex.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Requirements -
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Planned Changes -
   <br/>
   Litware plans to develop a new suite of applications for investment planning. The investment
                    planning applications will require only minor integration with the existing retirement fund
                    management system.
   <br/>
   The investment planning applications suite will include one multi-tier web application and two iOS
                    mobile applications. One mobile application will be used by employees; the other will be used by
                    customers.
   <br/>
   Litware plans to move to a more agile development methodology. Shared code will be extracted into a
                    series of packages.
   <br/>
   Litware has started an internal cloud transformation process and plans to use cloud-based services
                    whenever suitable.
   <br/>
   Litware wants to become proactive in detecting failures, rather than always waiting for customer bug
                    reports.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Technical Requirements -
   <br/>
   The company's investment planning applications suite must meet the following technical requirements:
   <br/>
   New incoming connections through the firewall must be minimized.
   <br/>
   Members of a group named Developers must be able to install packages.
   <br/>
   The principle of least privilege must be used for all permission assignments.
   <br/>
   A branching strategy that supports developing new functionality in isolation must be used.
   <br/>
   Members of a group named Team Leaders must be able to create new packages and edit the permissions
                    of package feeds.
   <br/>
   Visual Studio App Center must be used to centralize the reporting of mobile application crashes and
                    device types in use.
   <br/>
   By default, all releases must remain available for 30 days, except for production releases, which
                    must be kept for 60 days.
   <br/>
   Code quality and release quality are critical. During release, deployments must not proceed between
                    stages if any active bugs are logged against the release.
   <br/>
   The mobile applications must be able to call the share pricing service of the existing retirement
                    fund management system. Until the system is upgraded, the service will only support basic
                    authentication over HTTPS.
   <br/>
   The required operating system configuration for the test servers changes weekly. Azure Automation
                    State Configuration must be used to ensure that the operating system on each test server is
                    configured the same way when the servers are created and checked periodically.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Current Technical Issue -
   <br/>
   The test servers are configured correctly when first deployed, but they experience configuration
                    drift over time. Azure Automation State Configuration fails to correct the configurations.
   <br/>
   Azure Automation State Configuration nodes are registered by using the following command.

    Question
   </span>
   DRAG DROP -
   <br/>
   Which package feed access levels should be assigned to the Developers and Team Leaders groups for
                    the investment planning applications suite? To answer, drag the appropriate access levels to the
                    correct groups. Each access level may be used once, more than once, or not at all. You may need to
                    drag the split bar between panes or scroll to view content.
   <br/>
   NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

   This is a case study. Case studies are not timed separately. You can use as much exam time as you
                    would like to complete each case. However, there may be additional case studies and sections on this
                    exam. You must manage your time to ensure that you are able to complete all questions included on
                    this exam in the time provided.
   <br/>
   To answer the questions included in a case study, you will need to reference information that is

                    more information about the scenario that is described in the case study. Each question is
                    independent of the other questions in this case study.
   <br/>
   At the end of this case study, a review screen will appear. This screen allows you to review your
                    answers and to make changes before you move to the next section of the exam. After you begin a new

    Box 1: Azure Boards -
    <br/>
    Azure Boards can be used to track work with Kanban boards, backlogs, team dashboards, and custom
                        reporting
    <br/>
    You can create multiple Trello boards, which are spaces to store tasks (for different work
                        contexts, or even private boards)
    <br/>
    You can easily share Trello boards with another person.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Box 2: Azure Pipelines -
    <br/>
    You can use Bamboo to implement CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery) for a
                        simple Azure function app using Atlassian Bamboo. Bamboo does continuous delivery of the project
                        from source code to deployment. It has stages including Build, Test and Deploy.
    <br/>
    Software teams in every industry are upgrading their continuous delivery pipeline with Bamboo.
                        Easy build import from popular open source tools, user and group import from JIRA, seamless
                        integration with Bitbucket, and native support for Git, Hg, and SVN means you'll be building and
                        deploying like a champ.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Box 3: GitHub repositories -
    <br/>
    Bitbucket can be used as the Git repository, but you can use any other Git repository (Like TFS
                        Git) for source control of the code.

   Case Study -
   <br/>
   This is a case study. Case studies are not timed separately. You can use as much exam time as you
                    would like to complete each case. However, there may be additional case studies and sections on this
                    exam. You must manage your time to ensure that you are able to complete all questions included on
                    this exam in the time provided.
   <br/>
   To answer the questions included in a case study, you will need to reference information that is
                    provided in the case study. Case studies might contain exhibits and other resources that provide
                    more information about the scenario that is described in the case study. Each question is
                    independent of the other questions in this case study.
   <br/>
   At the end of this case study, a review screen will appear. This screen allows you to review your
                    answers and to make changes before you move to the next section of the exam. After you begin a new
                    section, you cannot return to this section.

                    buttons displays information such as business requirements, existing environment, and problem
                    statements. If the case study has an All Information tab, note that the information displayed is

    Step 1: Sign in to Azure Devops by using an account that is assigned the Administrator service
                        connection security role.
    <br/>
    Note: Under Agent Phase, click Deploy Service Fabric Application. Click Docker Settings and then
                        click Configure Docker settings. In Registry Credentials Source, select Azure Resource Manager
                        Service Connection. Then select your Azure subscription.
    <br/>
    Step 2: Create a personal access token..
    <br/>
    A personal access token or PAT is required so that a machine can join the pool created with the
                        Agent Pools (read, manage) scope.
    <br/>
    Step 3: Install and register the Azure Pipelines agent on an Azure virtual machine.
    <br/>
    By running a Azure Pipeline agent in the cluster, we make it possible to test any service,
                        regardless of type.

   Overview -
   <br/>
   Litware, Inc. is an independent software vendor (ISV). Litware has a main office and five branch
                    offices.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Existing Environment -
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Application Architecture -
   <br/>
   The company's primary application is a single monolithic retirement fund management system based on
                    ASP.NET web forms that use logic written in VB.NET.
   <br/>
   Some new sections of the application are written in C#.
   <br/>
   Variations of the application are created for individual customers. Currently, there are more than
                    80 live code branches in the application's code base.
   <br/>
   The application was developed by using Microsoft Visual Studio. Source code is stored in Team
                    Foundation Server (TFS) in the main office. The branch offices access the source code by using TFS
                    proxy servers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Architectural Issues -
   <br/>
   Litware focuses on writing new code for customers. No resources are provided to refactor or remove
                    existing code. Changes to the code base take a long time, as dependencies are not obvious to
                    individual developers.
   <br/>
   Merge operations of the code often take months and involve many developers. Code merging frequently
                    introduces bugs that are difficult to locate and resolve.
   <br/>
   Customers report that ownership costs of the retirement fund management system increase continually.
                    The need to merge unrelated code makes even minor code changes expensive.
   <br/>
   Customers report that bug reporting is overly complex.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Requirements -
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Planned Changes -
   <br/>
   Litware plans to develop a new suite of applications for investment planning. The investment
                    planning applications will require only minor integration with the existing retirement fund
                    management system.
   <br/>
   The investment planning applications suite will include one multi-tier web application and two iOS
                    mobile applications. One mobile application will be used by employees; the other will be used by
                    customers.
   <br/>
   Litware plans to move to a more agile development methodology. Shared code will be extracted into a
                    series of packages.
   <br/>
   Litware has started an internal cloud transformation process and plans to use cloud-based services
                    whenever suitable.
   <br/>
   Litware wants to become proactive in detecting failures, rather than always waiting for customer bug
                    reports.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Technical Requirements -
   <br/>
   The company's investment planning applications suite must meet the following technical requirements:
   <br/>
   New incoming connections through the firewall must be minimized.
   <br/>
   Members of a group named Developers must be able to install packages.
   <br/>
   The principle of least privilege must be used for all permission assignments.
   <br/>
   A branching strategy that supports developing new functionality in isolation must be used.
   <br/>
   Members of a group named Team Leaders must be able to create new packages and edit the permissions
                    of package feeds.
   <br/>
   Visual Studio App Center must be used to centralize the reporting of mobile application crashes and
                    device types in use.
   <br/>
   By default, all releases must remain available for 30 days, except for production releases, which
                    must be kept for 60 days.
   <br/>
   Code quality and release quality are critical. During release, deployments must not proceed between
                    stages if any active bugs are logged against the release.
   <br/>
   The mobile applications must be able to call the share pricing service of the existing retirement
                    fund management system. Until the system is upgraded, the service will only support basic
                    authentication over HTTPS.
   <br/>
   The required operating system configuration for the test servers changes weekly. Azure Automation
                    State Configuration must be used to ensure that the operating system on each test server is
                    configured the same way when the servers are created and checked periodically.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Current Technical Issue -
   <br/>
   The test servers are configured correctly when first deployed, but they experience configuration
                    drift over time. Azure Automation State Configuration fails to correct the configurations.
   <br/>
   Azure Automation State Configuration nodes are registered by using the following command.

   Case Study -
   <br/>
   This is a case study. Case studies are not timed separately. You can use as much exam time as you
                    would like to complete each case. However, there may be additional case studies and sections on this
                    exam. You must manage your time to ensure that you are able to complete all questions included on
                    this exam in the time provided.
   <br/>
   To answer the questions included in a case study, you will need to reference information that is
                    provided in the case study. Case studies might contain exhibits and other resources that provide

    Scenario: A branching strategy that supports developing new functionality in isolation must be
                        used.
    <br/>
    Feature isolation is a special derivation of the development isolation, allowing you to branch
                        one or more feature branches from main, as shown, or from your dev branches.
    <br/>
    <img class="in-exam-image" src="https://examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04156/0045800002.jpg"/>
    <br/>
    When you need to work on a particular feature, it might be a good idea to create a feature
                        branch.
    <br/>
    Incorrect Answers:
    <br/>
    A: Release isolation introduces one or more release branches from main. The strategy allows
                        concurrent release management, multiple and parallel releases, and codebase snapshots at release
                        time.
    <br/>
    B: The Main Only strategy can be folder-based or with the main folder converted to a Branch, to
                        enable additional visibility features. You commit your changes to the main branch and optionally
                        indicate development and release milestones with labels.
    <br/>
    C: Development isolation: When you need to maintain and protect a stable main branch, you can
                        branch one or more dev branches from main. It enables isolation and concurrent development. Work
                        can be isolated in development branches by feature, organization, or temporary collaboration.

   Case Study -
   <br/>
   This is a case study. Case studies are not timed separately. You can use as much exam time as you
                    would like to complete each case. However, there may be additional case studies and sections on this
                    exam. You must manage your time to ensure that you are able to complete all questions included on
                    this exam in the time provided.
   <br/>
   To answer the questions included in a case study, you will need to reference information that is
                    provided in the case study. Case studies might contain exhibits and other resources that provide
                    more information about the scenario that is described in the case study. Each question is
                    independent of the other questions in this case study.
   <br/>
   At the end of this case study, a review screen will appear. This screen allows you to review your
                    answers and to make changes before you move to the next section of the exam. After you begin a new
                    section, you cannot return to this section.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   To start the case study -
   <br/>
   To display the first question in this case study, click the Next button. Use the buttons in the left
                    pane to explore the content of the case study before you answer the questions. Clicking these
                    buttons displays information such as business requirements, existing environment, and problem
                    statements. If the case study has an All Information tab, note that the information displayed is
                    identical to the information displayed on the subsequent tabs. When you are ready to answer a
                    question, click the Question button to return to the question.

   <br/>
   Overview -
   <br/>
   Litware, Inc. is an independent software vendor (ISV). Litware has a main office and five branch
                    offices.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Existing Environment -
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Application Architecture -
   <br/>
   The company's primary application is a single monolithic retirement fund management system based on
                    ASP.NET web forms that use logic written in VB.NET.
   <br/>
   Some new sections of the application are written in C#.
   <br/>
   Variations of the application are created for individual customers. Currently, there are more than
                    80 live code branches in the application's code base.
   <br/>
   The application was developed by using Microsoft Visual Studio. Source code is stored in Team
                    Foundation Server (TFS) in the main office. The branch offices access the source code by using TFS
                    proxy servers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Architectural Issues -
   <br/>
   Litware focuses on writing new code for customers. No resources are provided to refactor or remove
                    existing code. Changes to the code base take a long time, as dependencies are not obvious to
                    individual developers.
   <br/>
   Merge operations of the code often take months and involve many developers. Code merging frequently
                    introduces bugs that are difficult to locate and resolve.
   <br/>
   Customers report that ownership costs of the retirement fund management system increase continually.
                    The need to merge unrelated code makes even minor code changes expensive.
   <br/>
   Customers report that bug reporting is overly complex.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Requirements -
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Planned Changes -
   <br/>
   Litware plans to develop a new suite of applications for investment planning. The investment
                    planning applications will require only minor integration with the existing retirement fund
                    management system.
   <br/>
   The investment planning applications suite will include one multi-tier web application and two iOS
                    mobile applications. One mobile application will be used by employees; the other will be used by
                    customers.
   <br/>
   Litware plans to move to a more agile development methodology. Shared code will be extracted into a
                    series of packages.
   <br/>
   Litware has started an internal cloud transformation process and plans to use cloud-based services
                    whenever suitable.
   <br/>
   Litware wants to become proactive in detecting failures, rather than always waiting for customer bug
                    reports.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Technical Requirements -
   <br/>
   The company's investment planning applications suite must meet the following technical requirements:
   <br/>
   New incoming connections through the firewall must be minimized.
   <br/>
   Members of a group named Developers must be able to install packages.
   <br/>
   The principle of least privilege must be used for all permission assignments.
   <br/>
   A branching strategy that supports developing new functionality in isolation must be used.
   <br/>
   Members of a group named Team Leaders must be able to create new packages and edit the permissions
                    of package feeds.
   <br/>
   Visual Studio App Center must be used to centralize the reporting of mobile application crashes and
                    device types in use.
   <br/>
   By default, all releases must remain available for 30 days, except for production releases, which
                    must be kept for 60 days.
   <br/>
   Code quality and release quality are critical. During release, deployments must not proceed between
                    stages if any active bugs are logged against the release.
   <br/>
   The mobile applications must be able to call the share pricing service of the existing retirement
                    fund management system. Until the system is upgraded, the service will only support basic
                    authentication over HTTPS.
   <br/>
   The required operating system configuration for the test servers changes weekly. Azure Automation
                    State Configuration must be used to ensure that the operating system on each test server is
                    configured the same way when the servers are created and checked periodically.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Current Technical Issue -
   <br/>
   The test servers are configured correctly when first deployed, but they experience configuration
                    drift over time. Azure Automation State Configuration fails to correct the configurations.
   <br/>
   Azure Automation State Configuration nodes are registered by using the following command.

    When a release is created from a release pipeline that defines approvals, the deployment stops
                        at each point where approval is required until the specified approver grants approval or rejects
                        the release (or re-assigns the approval to another user).

    Scenario: Code quality and release quality are critical. During release, deployments must not

   Overview -
   <br/>
   Litware, Inc. is an independent software vendor (ISV). Litware has a main office and five branch
                    offices.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Existing Environment -
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Application Architecture -
   <br/>
   The company's primary application is a single monolithic retirement fund management system based on
                    ASP.NET web forms that use logic written in VB.NET.
   <br/>
   Some new sections of the application are written in C#.
   <br/>
   Variations of the application are created for individual customers. Currently, there are more than
                    80 live code branches in the application's code base.
   <br/>
   The application was developed by using Microsoft Visual Studio. Source code is stored in Team
                    Foundation Server (TFS) in the main office. The branch offices access the source code by using TFS
                    proxy servers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Architectural Issues -
   <br/>
   Litware focuses on writing new code for customers. No resources are provided to refactor or remove
                    existing code. Changes to the code base take a long time, as dependencies are not obvious to
                    individual developers.
   <br/>
   Merge operations of the code often take months and involve many developers. Code merging frequently
                    introduces bugs that are difficult to locate and resolve.
   <br/>
   Customers report that ownership costs of the retirement fund management system increase continually.
                    The need to merge unrelated code makes even minor code changes expensive.
   <br/>
   Customers report that bug reporting is overly complex.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Requirements -
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Planned Changes -
   <br/>
   Litware plans to develop a new suite of applications for investment planning. The investment
                    planning applications will require only minor integration with the existing retirement fund
                    management system.
   <br/>
   The investment planning applications suite will include one multi-tier web application and two iOS
                    mobile applications. One mobile application will be used by employees; the other will be used by
                    customers.
   <br/>
   Litware plans to move to a more agile development methodology. Shared code will be extracted into a
                    series of packages.
   <br/>
   Litware has started an internal cloud transformation process and plans to use cloud-based services
                    whenever suitable.
   <br/>
   Litware wants to become proactive in detecting failures, rather than always waiting for customer bug
                    reports.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Technical Requirements -
   <br/>
   The company's investment planning applications suite must meet the following technical requirements:
   <br/>
   New incoming connections through the firewall must be minimized.
   <br/>
   Members of a group named Developers must be able to install packages.
   <br/>
   The principle of least privilege must be used for all permission assignments.
   <br/>
   A branching strategy that supports developing new functionality in isolation must be used.
   <br/>
   Members of a group named Team Leaders must be able to create new packages and edit the permissions
                    of package feeds.
   <br/>
   Visual Studio App Center must be used to centralize the reporting of mobile application crashes and
                    device types in use.
   <br/>
   By default, all releases must remain available for 30 days, except for production releases, which
                    must be kept for 60 days.
   <br/>
   Code quality and release quality are critical. During release, deployments must not proceed between
                    stages if any active bugs are logged against the release.
   <br/>
   The mobile applications must be able to call the share pricing service of the existing retirement
                    fund management system. Until the system is upgraded, the service will only support basic
                    authentication over HTTPS.
   <br/>
   The required operating system configuration for the test servers changes weekly. Azure Automation
                    State Configuration must be used to ensure that the operating system on each test server is
                    configured the same way when the servers are created and checked periodically.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Current Technical Issue -
   <br/>
   The test servers are configured correctly when first deployed, but they experience configuration
                    drift over time. Azure Automation State Configuration fails to correct the configurations.
   <br/>
   Azure Automation State Configuration nodes are registered by using the following command.

    Box 1: A source control system -
    <br/>
    A source control system, also called a version control system, allows developers to collaborate
                        on code and track changes. Source control is an essential tool for multi-developer projects.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Box 2: A hosted service -
    <br/>
    To build and deploy Xcode apps or Xamarin.iOS projects, you'll need at least one macOS agent. If
                        your pipelines are in Azure Pipelines and a Microsoft-hosted agent meets your needs, you can
                        skip setting up a self-hosted macOS agent.
    <br/>
    Scenario: The investment planning applications suite will include one multi-tier web application
                        and two iOS mobile applications. One mobile application will be used by employees; the other
                        will be used by customers.
